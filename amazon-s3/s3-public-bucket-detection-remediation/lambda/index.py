Security Control: Revert public ACLs on Amazon S3 buckets
Description:  Automated detection and remediation of public Amazon S3 buckets.
    The intention is to check at the ACL level of the bucket and if
    ACL=='public-read'||'public-read-write'||'authenticated-read'
    then set it back to 'private'
Runtime: Python 3.6
